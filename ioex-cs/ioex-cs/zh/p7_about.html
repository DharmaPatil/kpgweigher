Witnesses said the creature came out of the ocean near the Burger King at 42nd and 1st Avenue, startling many and stalling traffic. 
"The animal caused nearly four million dollars of damage to the neighborhood," said Joseph Valente, owner of "Sea Lions R' Us" at 43rd and 2nd. Onlookers to the scene said that the sea lion appeared ornery, but otherwise in good spirits.
